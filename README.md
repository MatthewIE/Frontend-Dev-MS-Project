# **Fan Created Website for Halsey (Musician)**

## Overview

As my first milestone project, I took an idea from the three listed themes Code Institute provided me in my Assessment Handbook. I selected theme #1 but decided to go along with one of my favourite artists instead of a band.

The final version of my project will be a **_fictional_** website which looks like it was created for the artist herself, with the intention of informing visitors the following:
 * General information
 * Achievements & Awards
 * Gallery of pictures
 * Albums released
 * Merchandise
 * Upcoming concerts
 * Tickets & Booking

## UX

The main reason for the creation of this website is to provide other people interested in the artists music an additional source for information. The site will satisfy the needs of users who are intrigued in further general knowledge of the artist, those who wish to purchase merchandise, those who would like to view upcoming concert dates and possibly purchase tickets.

* As a newcomer to the genre, I would like to learn more about the artist and her aspirations.
* As a fan of Halsey, I want to view pictures taken at one of her concerts.
  * I want to learn where to purchase merchandise.
  * I want to view upcoming performances & check ticket pricing. 
  * I want to discover Halsey's social media platforms.
  * I want to sign up for a newsletter where possible.

## Structure & Design

   * The colour scheme I chose to use was a simple ****?
   * My main font I decided to use was ****? with a fallback of ****?
   * I chose the image on my home page as it was eye catching and made the user aware of what is to be expected from the website.

## Testing phase

I used the W3C Validator Tool to ensure there were no errors or invalid code throughout coding and once I had finished my project.

* [W3C HTML](https://validator.w3.org/)
* [W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

I also used the Lighthouse feature of Inspect Element to check how my site ran and get an idea on where I can improve in future projects based on the performance results.
