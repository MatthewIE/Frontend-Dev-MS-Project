# **Fan Created Website for Halsey (Musician)**

## Overview

As my first milestone project, I took an idea from the three listed themes Code Institute provided me in my Assessment Handbook. I selected theme #1 but decided to go along with one of my favourite artists instead of a band.

The final version of my project will be a **_fictional_** website which looks like it was created for the artist herself, with the intention of informing visitors the following:
 * General information
 * Achievements & Awards
 * Gallery of pictures
 * Albums released
 * Merchandise
 * Upcoming concerts
 * Tickets & Booking

## UX

The main reason for the creation of this website is to provide other people interested in the artists music an additional source for information. The site will satisfy the needs of users who are intrigued in further general knowledge of the artist, those who wish to purchase merchandise, those who would like to view upcoming concert dates and possibly purchase tickets.

* As a newcomer to the genre, I would like to learn more about the artist and her aspirations.
* As a fan of Halsey, I want to view pictures taken at one of her concerts.
  * I want to learn where to purchase merchandise.
  * I want to view upcoming performances & check ticket pricing. 
  * I want to discover Halsey's social media platforms.
  * I want to sign up for a newsletter where possible.

## Structure & Design

   * The colour scheme I chose to use was white with some subtle black throughout.
   * My main font I decided to use was Karla with a fallback of Sans Serif.
   * I chose the image on my home page as it was eye catching and made the user aware of what is to be expected from the website, especially if they are a Halsey fan.

## Testing phase

I used the W3C Validator Tool to ensure there were no errors or invalid code throughout coding and once I had finished my project.

* [W3C HTML](https://validator.w3.org/)
* [W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

I played around with both Validators for hours on end, going from many many errors, to not being able to solve the remaining few.
1 error in CSS, asking me to add a digit on line 44 in .wrapper, after margin: 10 auto. <br>
There was also an error in socials telling me the "a" tag is not allowed as a child of "ul".

I also used the Lighthouse feature of Inspect Element to check how my site ran and get an idea on where I can improve in future projects based on the performance results.

## Deployment 

My project was submitted and deployed to Githup Pages with the following steps:

1. Login/Signup to GitHub and locate the [Repositories](https://github.com/MatthewIE?tab=repositories) section.
2. Select the Respository you wish to deploy and on the right hand side, select settings.
3. Locate the GitHub Pages section in the settings option, it is near the bottom.
4. Select Master as your branch and save.
5. You can now scroll back down to GitHub Pages once again and choose a custom domain name if you so please.

## Credits

I didn't use many of my sources that I will list below, little bits helped me to create my own code from multiple sources as I was having issues with my own code interfering with others code. Nothing has been directly copied, looking at other developers code layout helped me in creating my own code and putting it together.

Overall, [W3C](https://www.w3schools.com/) is a fantastic website and I would have had much more trouble without them and the replayability of Code Institute's walkthroughs.
