            <h2>Who is Halsey?</h2>
            <p>Ashley Nicolette Frangipane (born September 29, 1994), known professionally as Halsey is an American singer, songwriter, and activist. Gaining attention from self-released music on social media platforms, she was signed by Astralwerks in 2014 and released her debut EP, Room 93, later that year.
               Halsey has since earned a #1 album on the Billboard 200 with Hopeless Fountain Kingdom (2017), as well as two #2 albums with Badlands (2015) and Manic (2020), the latter of which became the highest-selling debut and the most streamed album by a female artist in 2020. She has earned two #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States, including "Closer", a collaboration with The Chainsmokers, and "Without Me"; she has also attained a top-five single with "Bad at Love". In total, Halsey has sold over one million albums and has been streamed over six billion times in the United States. All three of her studio albums have been supported by a headlining tour.
            Halsey is noted for her distinctive singing voice. Her awards and nominations include four Billboard Music Awards, one American Music Award, one GLAAD Media Award, an MTV Video Music Award, and two Grammy Award nominations. She was included on Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2020. Outside of her career, she has been involved in suicide prevention awareness, sexual assault victim advocacy, and racial justice protests.
